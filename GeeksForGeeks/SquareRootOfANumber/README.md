Problem Statement:


Given an integer n, find the square root of n. If n is not a perfect square, then return the floor value.

Floor value of any number is the greatest Integer which is less than or equal to that number

    Examples:

    Input: n = 5
    Output: 2
    Explanation: Since, 5 is not a perfect square, floor of square_root of 5 is 2.

    Input: n = 4
    Output: 2
    Explanation: Since, 4 is a perfect square, so its square root is 2.

> Expected Time Complexity: O(logn)
> Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

    Constraints:
    1 ≤ n ≤ 107
